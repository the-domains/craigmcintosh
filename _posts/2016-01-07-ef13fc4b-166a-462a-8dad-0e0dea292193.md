I have been on a life long journey of acadmic excellence, currently I hold a Higher National Certificate in Computing gained at the former [Napier Polytechnic][1] in 1992, a [Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Computer Networks and Distributed Systems][2] gained at [Napier University][1] in 2003, Recently I have added a [Master of Science Degree in Marketing][3] gained at [Edinburgh Napier University][1] in 2012 to my list of acadmic accomplishments. The next part of my acadmic journey will see my study for my PhD in Digital Marketing as and when I get the time to fit it in :-).

Below you will see a picture of Napier University Craiglockhart Campus as it was back when I was studying for my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Computer Networks and Distributed Systems. The sheer grandure of the building inspired me to achieve my best every day.

Below you can see a more updated photo of the now renamed Edinburgh Napier University as it was when I graduated in 2012 with my Master of Science Postgraduate Degree in Marketing. With the new additions to the old Craiglockhart campus brought a new modern approach to my learning experience, one that I know I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
